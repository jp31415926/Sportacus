## National Games 2014 Design Notes

For U12 and above, each division had 4 pools (a,b,c,d) with six teams per pool.  
Each team played each team in their pool for 5 pool play games.
The top two teams in each pool advanced to the medal rounds.
1st and 2nd places teams from different pools played each othet in a quarter final.
Winners of the quarter final advanced to the semi-finals.
Winners of the semi-finals advanced to the finals.

Losers followed the same track.  
For example, two semi-final losers played each other in what was called a final match.
There were not consolution matches per se.

U10 followed a power pool approach and will not be discused further.

Each game has three relevant properties:

Level - Uage/Gender/Program - U12B-Core

GroupType
  PP - Pool Play
  QF - Quarter final
  SF - Semi-final
  FM - Final
  SOF - Soccerfest
  VIP - VIP
  
GroupName
  For PP, it was the pool letter a,b,c,d
  
mysql> select distinct levelKey,groupType,groupName from games where groupType = 'PP' and levelKey = 'AYSO_U16G_Core';
+----------------+-----------+-----------+
| levelKey       | groupType | groupName |
+----------------+-----------+-----------+
| AYSO_U16G_Core | PP        | A         |
| AYSO_U16G_Core | PP        | B         |
| AYSO_U16G_Core | PP        | C         |
| AYSO_U16G_Core | PP        | D         |
+----------------+-----------+-----------+

mysql> select distinct levelKey,groupType,groupName from games where groupType = 'QF' and levelKey = 'AYSO_U16G_Core';
+----------------+-----------+-----------+
| levelKey       | groupType | groupName |
+----------------+-----------+-----------+
| AYSO_U16G_Core | QF        | 1         |
| AYSO_U16G_Core | QF        | 2         |
| AYSO_U16G_Core | QF        | 3         |
| AYSO_U16G_Core | QF        | 4         |
+----------------+-----------+-----------+

Did have some additional oddball group types and names for the select program which had different medal round rules.

One limit to the above approach is that game belongs to at mode most one pool.  
It does not handle cross pool play competitions which cropped for the U10 powerplay stuff.
It could also crop up in some tournaments with uneven number of teams with multiple programs.

GameTeam - GroupSlot

mysql> select distinct game.levelKey,game.groupType,game.groupName,groupSlot 
  from game_teams left join games as game on game.id = game_teams.gameId 
  where game.levelKey = 'AYSO_U16G_Core';

A simpliar approach was used for the 2012 national games as well as several of the section games.
Never did use it for the area games.

Group is a generic prefix.  
Round might be better in this context.  
Round robin games, Medal round.  
Final round etc all see to work.

There are no persistant round objects.  
Standings and such are always computed on the fly by querying all the relevant games.
Have not really found a use case for having a round object.

If all three round attributes wer moved to the game team object then we could probably deal with more complex inter-pool type play.
Almost all the related queries require joining games with their teams anyways.

With three attributes is is tempting to try and make round into a value object.

There is some complexity in assigning a team to specific round slot.  
A given project team will end up being assigned to multiple rounds i.e. round robin as well as medal rounds.

For 2104 I used the game_team relation to determine which rounds the team was assigned to.  
There was nothing that really prevented a team from incorrectly assigned.
But in practice it worked out okay.
I had a project team listing with one column for each round the team was assigned to.
I also had code to automatically advance teams from one round to another though it sometimes did not work.

So adding round_type,round_name,round_slot to game_team should work.
It's tempting to combine type and name into one value.  

round_type
round_name
round_slot

Aside: eliminate game completely and replace with one or more game_teams?

GameTeamReport
    protected $goalsScored;
    protected $goalsAllowed; To decide if the team won the game and if so by how much
    
    protected $pointsEarned;
    protected $pointsMinus;  Not really sure if need this or not.
    
    protected $sportsmanship; 
    protected $fudgeFactor;
    
    protected $playerWarnings;
    protected $playerEjections;
    
    protected $coachWarnings;
    protected $coachEjections;
    
    protected $benchWarnings;  For ussf mostly
    protected $benchEjections;
    
    protected $specWarnings;  Spectators
    protected $specEjections;

For ng2014 the game team report entity was a value object serialized into the game team entity.

Another approach would be to add the properties to the game team entity which makes the entity bigger and less flexable.

I have also tried having an independent game_team_report entity.  Bit more code but works well.  

One could imaging having different types of report entities for different tournaments.

Another idea is to have a game_team_misconduct entity with one entity for each actualy misconduct.
This would allow additional misconduct information (player number, type etc).
Eliminates the need for 8 individual misconduct summary fields.  Needs a bit of extra query processing.

Maybe call it conduct and allow for multiple sportsmanship entries as well.

Could probably even sneak in a fudge factor record.

### Workflow

A game may be scheduled without specifying the project teams.
All of the round information must be filled in.
round_name + level + project identifies a set of games for the round.
round_slot will distingush between teams within a round_name.

A report may or may not be filed for the game.  No report implies the game was not played.
Game status could be used to determine if the game should be counted.
Need to handle forfeits?

How to tell if s report was filed?
A null ProjectGameTeamReport entity?
Always have the report but use a flag within the report?
Use a score of null?
Use game status?

What happens if a report was accidentally filed?

The report status should include a review.

Need some sort of validation to ensure round_slot is consistent with project_team.
  Same round_slot for project team
  No dup teams
  Deal with inter pool play
