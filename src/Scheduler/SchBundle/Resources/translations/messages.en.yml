# This was added to get rid of the missing translation messages for the edit profile form
# The form derives from the FOSUserBundle form thus triggering translations
# Just using a straight replace here
#
# If we were really using translations then the form labels might be profile.edit.user_name
#
# Note: after updating this file, run app/console cache:clear even in development enviroment
